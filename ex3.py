#Declare a variable count and assign to it a value of 10
count = 10
print('Initially count is:', count)

#increment count by 5 and print the result

print('count + 5 is:', count)

#decrement count by 3 and print the result
count-=3
print('count - 3 is:', count)

#multiply count by 2 and print the result
count*=2
print('count * 2 is:', count)
